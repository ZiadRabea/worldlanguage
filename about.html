	 <section id="history">
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>World Language owes its inception to the passion for science and technology nurtured from an early age, particularly by our founder, Ziad Rabea. The journey began with the authoring of a scientific paper at the age of 12, followed by the creation of a social networking website comprising over 70,000 lines of code at the age of 14.</p>
        <p>At the age of 16, during a period of personal challenge, the idea for a voice-controlled AI programmer was conceived, motivated not solely by personal needs but also by the desire to provide a tool that could empower those facing adversity and individuals eager to embark on the coding journey.</p>
        <p>Concurrently, Ziad recognized the untapped potential for software development in younger family members. However, the complexity of English-centric programming languages posed a formidable barrier. In response, a two-year journey of development commenced, culminating in the birth of World Language â€“ the world's first multilingual AI-powered programming language.</p>

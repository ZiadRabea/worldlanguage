        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p style="white-space:nowrap">Worldlang was born from a deep passion for technology and a desire to break down barriers in software development. Founded by Ziad Rabea, the project started from humble beginnings—an early fascination with science and the desire to solve problems through technology. From authoring a scientific paper at age 12 to building a 70,000-line social networking platform at 14, Ziad's journey has been defined by relentless curiosity and the pursuit of innovation.

		Joined by Soundous Bensakesli, a brilliant young scientist in her own right, we form a team driven by intuition and the shared goal of empowering others. Our vision is simple yet profound: to create a world where programming is accessible to everyone, regardless of language barriers. This led to the development of Worldlang, the first multilingual AI-powered programming language.
	
		Worldlang is more than just a tool—it is a reflection of our belief that anyone, with the right resources, can achieve more than they ever imagined. It was built with the intention not only to teach coding but to foster a global community of learners and innovators, encouraging them to become even better than we are.
